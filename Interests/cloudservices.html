Whether you are running applications that share photos to millions of mobile 
users or you’re supporting the critical operations of your business, a cloud services platform
provides rapid access to flexible and low cost IT resources. With cloud computing, you don’t need 
to make large upfront investments in hardware and spend a lot of time on the heavy lifting of managing
that hardware. Instead, you can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
to power your newest bright idea or operate your IT department. You can access as many resources as you need, 
almost instantly, and only pay for what you use.</div>
                    	<div class="section" id="section2">How Does Cloud Computing Work?
Cloud computing provides a simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a broad set of application services over the Internet. A Cloud services platform such as Amazon Web Services owns and maintains 
the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.</div>
                    	<div class="section" id="section3">Security is the major issue in 
                    	cloud computing. The cloud service providers implement the best security 
                    	standards and industry certifications, however, storing data and important 
                    	files on external service providers always bears a risk.

AWS cloud infrastructure is designed to be the most flexible and secured cloud network.
It provides scalable and highly reliable platform that enables customers to deploy applications and data quickly and securely.
