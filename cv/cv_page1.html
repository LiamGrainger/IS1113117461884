The school was established here in Douglas in the latter stage of the 1900's and since then it has been educating the boys from the Douglas area, with students at the school hailing from many different nationalities.Situated on a five acre campus in the heart of Douglas, this school has been a centre for learning for over 100 years.Its most important resource is the staff, the Principal, class teachers and learning support teachers. They also have, in addition classroom assistants, administrative and maintenance staff</p>

They believe that a broad, balanced, educational experience will allow their pupils to reach their full potential. Their other school partners, comprised of an active Parents Association, a dedicated Board of Management and supportive Patron, all strive to provide the very best educational experience for its pupils.</p>

Quality delivery of our programmes and the health and safety of our patrons are our main objectives when it comes to children.  </p>

                                      <p> For two years I have also worked as a community volunteer with the charitable organisation, Cork Penney Dinners. Cork Penny Dinners is a warm dry place in the heart of Cork City with a welcoming atmosphere. The premises is open to all 7 days a week all year round, No questions are asked, no judgements are made. Cork Penny Dinners is currently serving up to 2000 freshly made meals per week at our premises compared to approximately 150 or less per week prior to the recession. </p>
                                      <p>Volunteers come from all walks of life; nurses, truck drivers,scientists, general operatives, musicians, teachers, students, solicitors, unemployed people, retired people and clergy. Volunteers are made up of many different nationalities, but what they all have in common is empathy for our fellow human beings and a willingness to offer a hand in support. Service users and volunteers at Cork Penny Dinners interact with good humour and mutual respect always. Fundraising comes from individuals, companies, local organisations and businesses, social and sporting clubs. Many help with donations from their voluntary fundraising events which they have organised for the charity's benefit and also donate goods, produce and expertise.  </p>
