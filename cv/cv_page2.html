                                            <p class="ex1" style="font-family:Segoe UI;"> At four years of age, I attended my local primary school, a short walk from where I live. The school was established here in Douglas in the latter stage of the 1900's and since then it has been educating the boys from the Douglas area, with students at the school hailing from many different nationalities.Situated on a five acre campus in the heart of Douglas, this school has been a centre for learning for over 100 years.Its most important resource is the staff, the Principal, class teachers and learning support teachers. They also have, in addition classroom assistants, administrative and maintenance staff</p>
                                            <p class="ex1" style="font-family:Segoe UI;"> St.Columba's aims to strive to provide a very high standard of education within a happy caring environment. They believe that a broad, balanced, educational experience will allow their pupils to reach their full potential. Their other school partners, comprised of an active Parents Association, a dedicated Board of Management and supportive Patron, all strive to provide the very best educational experience for its pupils.</p>

                                            <p class="ex1" style="font-family:Segoe UI;">I completed my Secondary-Level Education at St.Francis College,Rochestown. Founded in 1884 by the Capuchin Franciscans, Rochestown College is dedicated to fostering the spirit of Saint Francis of Assisi - his commitment to hard work, his kindness and his strong sense of community. The college provides an environment in which your son can grow academically, spiritually, socially and morally.</p>
                                            <p class="ex1" style="font-family:Segoe UI;">The College has a highly-qualified and dedicated staff whose main concern is the academic and general welfare of the pupils and who assist them to reach their maximum potential. The College is under the trusteeship of the Capuchin Franciscan Order. Our College Chaplain is an important member of this team and is available to ensure that the transition from Primary to Secondary school as smooth as possible.</p>
                                          <p class="ex1" style="font-family:Segoe UI;">Throughout the College, modern teaching aids are used extensively to help ensure that our pupils get the maximum benefit from their classroom time. On three afternoons a week, the pupils have the option of participating in supervised study from 4 to 6pm. This additional facility helps the pupil to establish good, regular study habits.</p>
                                          <p class="ex1" style="font-family:Segoe UI;">Sport and physical education are an important part of the curriculum right through to the Leaving Certificate. The College has its own playing pitches as well as a large, modern, well-equipped sports hall suitable for a variety of indoor sports.</p>
