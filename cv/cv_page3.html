            <h2> Voluntary Work</h2>
            <p><strong>Organisation: </strong> Cork Penney Dinners</p>
            <p><strong>Role: </strong> Kitchen Staff & Runner</p>
            <p><strong>Duration: </strong> 2014 - Present</p>
            <p><strong>Job Description: </strong>Since I was given the opporutnity in Transition Year of Secondary School, I have been working as a volunteer with Cork Penney Dinenrs.
            Cork Penny Dinners is a warm dry place in the heart of Cork City with a welcoming atmosphere.
            The premises is open to all 7 days a week all year round, No questions are asked, no judgements are made. 

All their services are free of charge to those that need them and their friendly volunteers ensure that their service users 
are well looked after on a daily basis. 
Their door is always open, they never judge, they serve.
Cork Penny Dinners is currently serving up to 2000 freshly made meals per week at our premises compared to approximately 150 or less 
per week prior to the recession. 
Sometimes a cup of tea, a handshake or a friendly chat can go a long way towards beating 
the loneliness and isolation that is a big issue for many that come to the Cork Penney Dinner's door. 
There has also been a huge increase in homelessness and mental health issues that are 
affecting so many people which have forced them to avail of our services, most notably 
in the last few years,with a big increase in the number of families availing of our service.

My fellow volunteers come from all walks of life; nurses, truck drivers,scientists, general operatives, 
musicians, teachers, students, solicitors, unemployed people, retired people and clergy. We are
made up of many different nationalities, but what we all have in common is empathy for our fellow human beings and 
a willingness to offer a hand in support. Service users and volunteers at Cork Penny Dinners interact with good humour and mutual respect always.
Since taking up the position, my volunteer work has provided me with a deeper understanding of the plight of those less fortunate than myself, and in turn has made me more grateful and appreciative for what I've often taken for granted.
