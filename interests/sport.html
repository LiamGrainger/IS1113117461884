<p style = font-family: Segoe>A fine interest in hurling has been distilled in me from a young age. I play with Blackrock , 
"The Rockies", located in the fishing-town village of Blackrock, who are famous for their green and 
gold stripes and numerous accolades. Blackrock Hurling Club is synonymous with the local community. It
is an inclusive, democratic organisation and everyone is welcome to join. The club is rich in history 
and achievments on the sporting field and is primarily a sporting organisation, however, it goes beyond 
the simple provision of a sporting outlet for the community. The personal development of all its youngsters is an important goal of the club 
through commitment, personal dedication and discipline. The club provides the youth of the community a 
chance to develop in a positive sporting environment while learning the values of teamwork
and developing their social skills. A safe place to enjoy sports and make friends.</p>

 <h1>Gaelic Football</h1>

</p>
<p>I also have a keen interest in Gaelic Footbal, and I am a member of my local Gaelic Football Club , 
St.Michaels. Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland 
in terms of attendance, and the final of the All-Ireland Senior Championship, held annually at Croke Park, Dublin, draws crowds of more than 80,000 people. Outside Ireland, football is mainly played among members of the Irish diaspora. Gaelic Park in New York City is the largest purpose-built Gaelic sports venue outside Ireland. Three major football competitions operate throughout the year: the National Football League and the All-Ireland Senior Championship operate on an inter-county basis, while the All-Ireland Club Championship is contested by individual clubs. 
The All-Ireland Senior Championship is considered the most prestigious event in Gaelic football.</p>

 <h1>Politics</h1>

<p>The great George Bernard Shaw once said that there's no tougher sport than the game of Government. Indeed, Politics and Current Affairs are two more topics which I have a strong interest in. Both domestically and aborad, the ever changing and eve tumultous face of Politics has always proved a provoking topic. 
A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries. Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.
The Constitution of Ireland vests executive authority in a government which is headed by the Taoiseach, the head of government. The government is composed of government ministers, all of whom must be members of the Irish parliament. The Taoiseach must be nominated and approved by Leinster House, the lower house of the Oireachtas, the Irish legislature.</p>
